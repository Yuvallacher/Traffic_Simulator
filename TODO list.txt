PROJECTS:

1. accident detection and handling
    self.shouldSwitchLane = True
    emergency lane switching - lower the distance threshold to allow for more "close" switches
    despawn vehicles in accidents after some time (3 seconds?)

2. create new road types - curve, plus-junction, T-junction (maybe juncion class and then inheritence?)
    when adding a new road type: 
        add data to JSON
        add RoadBuilder method to read from JSON (like RoadBuilder.straight_road_read_lanes_from_file)
        visualisation:
            create new road pictures (e.g. two-way straight road with a continous seperating line! currently we incorrectly use the one-way straight road pictures)
            scale road pictures and put in the correct place on the screen!!!!

3. finishing touches on vehicle model

4. add hazards - traffric lights, signs, horse on road (road works), etc.

5. add curve mishandling - possibility of entering opposite lane if entering a curve at high speeds

6. add user interface with scrollers, buttons and stuff like that to allow users to controll the environment variables






EXTRA (if have time):

1. add documentation to difficult to understand function (in the """ comment """ way)

2. change all the drawRoad, drawCar functions in main.py (possibly delete them and write new functions)

3. add background colors / pictures
