@seanbar2000 :

create new road pictures (e.g. two-way straight road with a continous seperating line! currently we incorrectly use the one-way straight road pictures)
    scale road pictures and put in the correct place on the screen!!!!



@orenlan1 :

create new road types - curve, plus-junction, T-junction (maybe juncion class and then inheritence?)
    when adding a new road type: 
        add data to JSON
        add RoadBuilder method to read from JSON (like RoadBuilder.straight_road_read_lanes_from_file)

@orenlan1 @seanbar2000 @Yuvallacher :

change all the drawRoad, drawCar functions in main.py (possibly delete them and write new functions)

add user interface with scrollers, buttons and stuff like that to allow users to controll the environment variables

accident detection and handling
    self.shouldSwitchLane = True
    emergency lane switching - lower the distance threshold to allow for more "close" switches

if we have time - add pedestrians to crosswalks
