The project aims to create a realistic model of traffic flow. This simulation provides insights into driver-interactions and the impact of various parameters on the overall traffic system. By simulating different scenarios, we hope to analyse and optimize traffic management strategies, study driver behaviour, and identify potential improvements in road design and traffic policies via exporting the simulation data to an external file for later examination.
